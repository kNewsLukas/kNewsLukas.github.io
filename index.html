                    Welcome at <strong>funding.kNews.space</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is where you can chose how to become a kNews Booster to support me producing entertaining and informational content, that I mostly share on my social media accounts on YouTube and Twitter.

                    How close am I to minimum wage?<br/>
                    (as of November 22nd 2019)

                            ca. 4% (still at loss sadly)

                <p>
                    This progress bar is a rough approximation of all my channel's revenue streams combined on a monthly basis. I try to be as transparent as possible about it and update it regularily.<br/>
                    Minimum wage would of course not be enough to make a good living, but my funding goal is to "only" cover the basics, so that I can do this full time, without having to worry about not being able to pay for the most essential things. Everything beyond that is a bonus for me.

            <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
            <p>
                Hey there! My name is Lukas and I do original animation content on YouTube and Twitter. I don't want to inherit all the bad aspects of being public figure while not enjoying the good ones, so I don't share much personal information about me online. However, I believe my content reflects a lot of who I am and I hope that I am worth your support. If you need more information about me or anything else, I am also always happy to read and answer your emails! Please <strong>read the NDA</strong> before you do that.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div id="gif1" class="content-gif"></div>
            <div class="content-item">
            <h3>Why Support Me?</h3>
            <p>
                My mission is to create frequent and unique content, that keeps increasing in quality. I need the financial support simply to spend more time on it and less on other projects to make a living. To be clear: Supporting me means supporting me producing my content. I love video and animation and I <strong>don't want</strong> to hire people who do it for me, so that I could focus on selling stuff or do other things. I'm aware that some people do that and strive for a career in counting money. That's not who I am and what kNews.space is about. I want to do this until I'm old and grey!

            <div id="you" class="content-item">
            <h3 id="you">YouTube Membership</h3>
            <p>
                If you have a Google Account on your smartphone that is already linked to a payment method, then this is the easiest option for you. You will get some small perks on YouTube like a kNews Booster Icon in the comments and access to the member-only community threads, where your comments are only read by me and members, not the general public. This is great for people who like to comment but at the same time try to limit the size of their footprint online.
            </p>
            </div>
            <div id="pat" class="content-item">
            <h3 id="pat">Patreon</h3>
            <p>
                If you don't mind making a new account and would like to avoid Google and YouTube, but still want to support my content, then using Patreon is a great option. However, I am not as active on there and you won't get any of the benefits on YouTube. I do not offer any special perks to my supporters, because I want to use your funding to create more and better content, not sell the perks. I hope that makes sense!
            </p>
            </div>
            <div id="pay" class="content-item">
            <h3 id="pay">Paypal</h3>
            <p>
                This option means to send me your financial support directly via Paypal. Now, because this could turn into an accounting nightmare keeping track of many micropayments, I reserve this option only for people who want to support me by a more considerable amount at a time, bypassing the fees of the other options. If you want to send a year's worth of support at once, this is for you! Simply contact me via email in that case. Please <strong>read the NDA</strong> before you do that.
            </p>

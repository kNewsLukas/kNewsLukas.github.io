                This is where you can chose how to become a kNews Booster to support me producing entertaining and informational content, that I mostly share on my social media accounts on YouTube and Twitter.

            <h3>Who Am I?</h3>
            <p>
                Hey there! My name is Lukas and I do original animation content on YouTube and Twitter. I don't want to inherit all the bad aspects of being public figure while not enjoying the good ones, so I don't share much personal information about me online. However, I believe my content reflects a lot of who I am and I hope that I am worth your support. If you need more information about me or anything else, I am also always happy to answer you emails! <strong>Read the NDA</strong> before you do that please!
            </p>

            <h3>Why Support Me?</h3>
            <p>
                My mission is to create frequent and unique content, that keeps increasing in quality. I need the financial support simply to spend more time on it and less on other projects to make a living. To be clear: Supporting me means supporting me producing my content. I love video and animation and I don't want to hire people who do it for me, so that I can focus on selling stuff or do other things. I'm aware that some people do that and strive for a career in counting money. That's not who I am and what kNews is about. I want to do this until I'm old and grey. Just not from my parent's basement..

            <h3>Non Disclosure Agreement</h3>
            <p>
                Contacting me via below mentioned e-mail address for the reasons listed on this page at funding.kNews.space, you agree to <strong>not disclose the contents of our email exchange</strong> to other entities. You also agree to not make these contents public or accessible to third parties. I agree to do the same out of respect to your privacy and additionally agree to not share your e-mail address with private or commercial third parties, or use it for any other purpose than to answer your e-mails with relevant information. I reserve the right to not answer your email(s) and/or forward them to local authorities given a case of criminal offense against me or another person.

            <h3>YouTube Membership (My Favorite)</h3>
            <p>
                If you have a Google Account on your smartphone that is already linked to a payment method, then this is the easiest option for you. You will get some small perks on YouTube like a kNews Booster Icon in the comments and access to the member-only community threads, where your comments are only read by me and members, not the general public. This is great for people who like to comment but at the same time try to limit the size of their footprint online.

            <h3>Patreon</h3>
            <p>
                If you don't mind making a new account and would like to avoid Google and YouTube, but still want to support my content, then using Patreon is a great option. However, I am not as active on there and you won't get any of the benefits on YouTube. I do not offer any special perks to my supporters, because I want to use your funding to create more and better content, not sell the perks. I hope that makes sense!

            <h3>Paypal</h3>
            <p>
                This option means to send me your financial support directly via Paypal. Now, because this could turn into an accounting nightmare keeping track of many micropayments, I reserve this option only for people who want to support me by a more considerable amount at a time, byassing the fees of the other options. If you want to send a year's worth of support at once, this is for you! Simply contact me via email in that case. <strong>Read the NDA</strong> before you do that please!

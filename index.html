            <h3>Why support me and why do I need it?</h3>
            <p>
                Monthly recurring payments like these are great because they provide a form of safety. I do not have to constantly think about how am I going to pay my bills with making videos.

            <h3>YouTube Membership</h3>
            <p>
                If you have a Google Account on your smartphone that is already linked to a payment menthod, then this is the easiest option for you. You will get some small perks on YouTube like a kNews Booster Icon in the comments and access to the member-only community threads where your comments are only read by me and members, not the general public. This is great for people who like to comment but at the same time try to limit their online footprint.

            <h3>Patreon</h3>
            <p>
                If you don't mind making a new account and would like to avoid Google and YouTube, but still would like to support my content then using Patreon is a great option. However, I am not as active on there
